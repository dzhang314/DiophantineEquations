\textbf{Lemma:} Let $n \in \Z$. If $p$ is an odd prime factor of $n^2 + 1$, then $p \equiv 1 \pmod 4$.

\textit{Proof:} Let $p$ be an odd prime. If $p \mid (n^2 + 1)$, then $n^2 \equiv -1 \pmod p$, which shows that $-1$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$. Using the properties of the Legendre symbol, it follows that
\[ 1 = \left( \frac{-1}{p} \right) = (-1)^{(p-1)/2} \]
which shows that $(p-1)/2$ is an even number. \textbf{QED}

\textbf{Theorem:} The Diophantine equation
\[ x^2 y + y^2 + z^2 + 1 = 0 \]
has no integer-valued solutions.

\textit{Proof:} We proceed by contradiction. Using the substitution $y \mapsto -y$, we can rewrite this equation as
\[ y(x^2 - y) = z^2 + 1. \]
In other words, this equation expresses $z^2 + 1$ as a product of two integers whose sum is a perfect square. Observe that both of the factors, $y$ and $x^2 - y$, must be positive.

Recall that every perfect square is congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4. Hence, the right-hand side of this equation is congruent to 1 or 2 modulo 4. There are two ways to express each of these quantities as a product modulo 4:
\[ 1 \times 1 \equiv 3 \times 3 \equiv 1 \pmod 4 \qquad\qquad 1 \times 2 \equiv 3 \times 2 \equiv 2 \pmod 4 \]
Thus, the two factors on the left-hand side must be congruent to $(1, 1)$, $(3, 3)$, $(1, 2)$, or $(2, 3)$ modulo 4. The first three options are impossible because their sum modulo 4 is not 0 or 1. The preceding lemma implies that the final option is impossible, since no odd prime factor of $z^2 + 1$ (and hence, by induction, no odd factor of $z^2 + 1$) can be congruent to 3 modulo 4. \textbf{QED}

\textbf{Theorem:} The Diophantine equation
\[ x^2 y + 3y + z^2 + 1 = 0 \]
has no integer-valued solutions.

\textit{Proof:} Substitute $y \mapsto -y$ to obtain the equation $y(x^2 + 3) = z^2 + 1$. Working modulo 4, the right-hand side is either 1 or 2, while $x^2 + 3$ is either 0 or 3. Observe that $x^2 + 3 \equiv 0$ is impossible because it would force the right-hand side to be 0, and $x^2 + 3 \equiv 3$ is impossible by the preceding lemma. \textbf{QED}
